\section{Why our approach did not work?} 
Several factors may contribute to this performance degradation. One hypothesis is a representation-behavior mismatch, where the compression process perturbs the latent representations in a way that hinders the decoder's ability to perform tasks like tool use. Other contributing factors include a drop in reconstruction quality for specialized content, such as code, and potential overfitting to training labels, as suggested by high local accuracy but low overall task resolution rates.
